# Ferroelectric Phase Field Simulation Code
Using this code, you can simulate defects doped ferroelectric material, aging behavior of ferroelectric material and relaxor ferroelectric material.
You can download them and use them in the way you want except commercial use. More details can be seen in LISENCE.
If you have any question about how the code works and how to set every parameter, you can contact me through wzy.kurtfm@gmail.com, I'm happy to answer any question about these code.
